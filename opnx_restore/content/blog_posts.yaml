      blog_posts_content: "<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><br />FLEX Coin is the native exchange token powering the CoinFLEX ecosystem. Originally minted as an SLP token, FLEX has expanded into a multi-chain token on Ethereum (ERC20) and SmartBCH (SEP20).&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><br />Let's take a closer look at FLEX and focus on its deflationary characteristics, rebalancing mechanism across different blockchains, and current circulating supply.<br /><br /><br /></h4>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the maximum supply of FLEX?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the <a href=\"https://simpleledger.info/tx/fb1813fd1a53c1bed61f15c0479cc5315501e6da6a4d06da9d8122c1a4fabb6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">genesis transaction</a>, the supply of FLEX was fixed at 100M tokens on SLP with no option for further minting. CoinFLEX has pledged to buy and burn FLEX using 20% of its profits to further maintain the deflationary nature of the token.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the FLEX rebalancing mechanism?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To maintain the correct circulating supply of FLEX across all supported chains, CoinFLEX employs a rebalancing mechanism.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When FLEX Coin holders&rsquo; activity shifts to a blockchain with a lower current circulating supply, CoinFLEX reduces the circulating supply on the less active chain and increases the supply on the one gaining traction. To support increasing withdrawals to ERC20 and SEP20, SLP FLEX Coins are locked into the dedicated CoinFLEX Treasury Wallet, removing them from the circulating supply, and FLEX is minted on Ethereum or SmartBCH as needed in amounts equal to those sent to the Treasury Wallet, therefore keeping the total circulating supply unchanged.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is necessary as the minting baton for the token on SLP has been destroyed, and burning FLEX on SLP would reduce the supply, making it impossible to ensure there is enough FLEX for users who wish to move back to SLP from ERC20 or SEP20 if that was ever the case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, if a user moves 100 FLEX from SLP to ERC20, CoinFLEX sends 100 SLP FLEX to the secure Treasury Wallet and mints 100 ERC20 FLEX. Conversely, if a user would move 100 FLEX from ERC20 to SLP, CoinFLEX would burn 100 ERC20 FLEX and unlock 100 of the locked SLP FLEX from the Treasury Wallet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This rebalancing mechanism is vital for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the FLEX ecosystem across all chains. By implementing this mechanism, CoinFLEX ensures that the correct supply of FLEX exists on each chain, and users can move between chains without worrying about supply imbalances.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><br />How much FLEX has been burned?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CoinFLEX has burned a total of xxxx FLEX, which can be verified on the SLP, Ethereum, and SmartBCH blockchain explorers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here, you can see the total amount locked on Bitcoin Cash (SLP): <a href=\"https://simpleledger.info/address/simpleledger\">https://simpleledger.info/address/simpleledger</a>:qzt2nkt7rcf4j6wu07l77qfe70rpmzujkua89slazr</p>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here, you can see the total amount burned on Ethereum (ERC20): <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0xFcF8eda095e37A41e002E266DaAD7efC1579bc0A\">https://etherscan.io/token/0xFcF8eda095e37A41e002E266DaAD7efC1579bc0A</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here, you can see the total amount burned on SmartBCH (SEP20): <a href=\"https://sonar.cash/token/0x98Dd7eC28FB43b3C4c770AE532417015fa939Dd3/token-transfers\">https://sonar.cash/token/0x98Dd7eC28FB43b3C4c770AE532417015fa939Dd3/token-transfers</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><br />What is the current circulating supply of FLEX?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of 24-Feb-2023, the current circulating supply of FLEX is 98,665,019.4865964*.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The existing circulating supply of FLEX is determined by subtracting the number of burned FLEX and the number of FLEX held in the CoinFLEX SLP Treasury Wallet from the total 100M token supply. This information is verifiable on the <a href=\"https://simpleledger.info/token/fb1813fd1a53c1bed61f15c0479cc5315501e6da6a4d06da9d8122c1a4fabb6c\">Bitcoin Cash (SLP</a>), <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0xFcF8eda095e37A41e002E266DaAD7efC1579bc0A\">Ethereum (ERC20)</a>, and <a href=\"https://sonar.cash/token/0x98Dd7eC28FB43b3C4c770AE532417015fa939Dd3/token-transfers\">SmartBCH (SEP20)</a> blockchain explorers.</p>\n<p>The amount of FLEX tokens held in the CoinFLEX secure Treasury Wallet can be verified <a href=\"https://simpleledger.info/address/simpleledger:qzt2nkt7rcf4j6wu07l77qfe70rpmzujkua89slazr\">here</a>.<br /><br /><br /></p>"

      blog_posts_content: "<p><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\">Dear CoinFLEX Community</span></p>\n<div>\n<p>We are excited to announce that following scheduled maintenance on January 31st,&nbsp;the funding rate for perpetual futures will no longer be based on an hourly repo auction. Instead, it will be determined by the following formula:</p>\n<p>Premium Rate = TWAP of ((Mark Price &ndash; Index price) / Index price)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Funding Rate = (Premium Rate + clamp(-Premium Rate, Max%, Min%)) / 24</p>\n<p>Any open positions and orders will remain open. Any pending deliveries will be canceled and need to be re-submitted as regular orders in the repo market as repo will no longer feature hourly auctions.</p>\n<p>We understand that the repo auction is something the community has grown accustomed to and we do not take this decision lightly. However, we see value in re-opening the exchange with perpetual futures contracts that are fungible from a pricing &amp; trading perspective, with the prevailing industry standard, and believe that this change in funding mechanism achieves that goal.</p>\n<p>This change removes barriers to entry for perp traders who have built systems to trade the dominant crypto derivatives contract (stablecoin margined perps). At the same time, we continue to see the value of implied orders and the need for easy-to-use, two-way conversions between perp positions and spot. Therefore, the repo market will continue to exist and function as an all-to-all &ldquo;Exchange of Futures for Physical&rdquo; (EFP) market. Traders will be able to trade basis and take out loans directly in the repo market like they do today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>IMPORTANT</p>\n<p>After the scheduled maintenance is complete, open perp positions will start to incur funding payments based on the updated funding rate mechanism.</p>\n<p>AMMs redeemed using &ldquo;Physical Delivery&rdquo; may pay or earn slippage depending on the repo market orderbook at the time of redemption.</p>\n<h2>Changes</h2>\n<h4>Delivery</h4>\n<p>Delivering on screen may be done via a &ldquo;limit&rdquo; or &ldquo;market&rdquo; delivery. Limit deliveries place GTC orders at 0% in Repo meaning that only positive slippage can be incurred. Market deliveries place an FOK order at the sanity bound and display a slippage estimate in dollar and percentage terms. Deliveries are reported in the order and trade history. It&rsquo;s also possible to deliver positions by trading in the repo book directly without using the delivery feature.</p>\n<p>Algorithmic traders should trade directly in the repo order book to effect deliveries.</p>\n<h4>Mark Price</h4>\n<p>The mark price will be used to calculate mark-to-market PnLs, funding rates, and initial and maintenance margins.</p>\n<p>Mark Price = Index Price + Premium Moving Average</p>\n<p>Premium Moving Average = Moving Average((Bid + Ask) / 2 &ndash; Index Price)</p>\n<p>Bid-ask spread* = (Ask &ndash; Bid) / Index Price</p>\n<p>Where Bid and Ask are the best bid and ask prices.</p>\n<p>*If the bid-ask spread is greater than 2%, then the market is considered dislocated, and the premium measurements begin to default to 0. If the bid-ask spread remains greater than 2% for two minutes, the mark price will equal the index price.</p>\n<h4>Funding Rate</h4>\n<p>Funding payments will continue to occur hourly. The funding rate will no longer be based on a repo auction, instead it will be determined by the following formula.</p>\n<p>Premium Rate = TWAP of ((Mark Price &ndash; Index price) / Index price)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Funding Rate = (Premium Rate + clamp(-Premium Rate, Max%, Min%)) / 24</p>\n<p>Funding Payment = Position Size * Mark Price * Funding Rate<br /><br />The clamp works as a dampener on the funding rate. In plain English, the funding rate will settle at 0.00% as long as the premium rate is between the max% and the min%. The default min/max values in majors and permissioned altcoins are 0.02%. The default minimum and maximum hourly funding rates are -+0.075%. These values may be changed over time, and exogenous factors such as hard forks.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Repo Tick Size</h4>\n<p>Repo tick sizes will be increased to 0.001%.</p>\n<h4>AMM</h4>\n<p>AMMs with pending deliveries will have their deliveries canceled.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AMMs redeemed using &ldquo;Physical Delivery&rdquo; may pay or earn slippage depending on the repo market order book at the time of redemption.</p>\n<h4>Quarterly Futures</h4>\n<p>Quarterly futures will continue to convert into perpetual futures positions on expiry. Remaining perpetual futures can either be closed in the perpetual market or converted to spot by trading in the repo market.</p>\n<h4>API</h4>\n<p>Deprecated:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: auto;\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\">POST /v2.1/delivery/orders</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">DELETE /v2.1/delivery/orders/{deliveryOrderId}</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">POST /v2/borrow</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">POST /v2/repay</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v2/deliver-auction</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v2.1/deliver-auction/{instrumentId}</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v2/funding-rates/{marketCode}</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v3/delivery/working</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v3/funding-rates</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v3/auction</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br />Updated:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: auto;\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v3/funding/estimates\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: auto;\">\n<li aria-level=\"2\">Removed the &ldquo;netDelivered&rdquo; field</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v3/funding/rates&nbsp;\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: auto;\">\n<li aria-level=\"2\">Removed the &ldquo;netDelivered&rdquo; field</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v3/funding&nbsp;\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: auto;\">\n<li aria-level=\"2\">Renamed the &ldquo;markPrice&rdquo; field to &ldquo;indexPrice&rdquo;</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GET /v3/markets&nbsp;\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: auto;\">\n<li aria-level=\"2\">Added an &ldquo;indexPrice&rdquo; field to the following markets:\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: initial;\">\n<li aria-level=\"3\">Spot</li>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">Perps</li>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">Repo</li>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">Permissionless perps</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">Removed the &ldquo;markPrice&rdquo; field from the following markets:\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: initial;\">\n<li aria-level=\"3\">Spot</li>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">Repo</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"
